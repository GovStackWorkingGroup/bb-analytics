title: Data Access
description: |
  Consuming systems and BI tools read indicator values, provenance records and dataset contents.
  Indicator values are delivered in standard formats (JSON-stat and CSV) with SDMX terms and code
  lists, limited to what the caller is authorised to see.

# Data Access

The **values API** is the core access to indicator values. It follows the principle _SDMX as the model, JSON-stat as the format_: terms, code lists and time formats come from SDMX, and values are delivered in two mandatory formats. JSON-stat 2.0 is the default for web applications and dashboards; CSV in long format is meant for Excel, scripts and simple tools. Because JSON-stat has no query language of its own, this specification defines the query itself.

## Query

| Level | Definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Format | JSON-stat 2.0, class `dataset` for indicator values; class `collection` for the list of indicators (recommended). |
| Query | `GET /indicators/{indicator_id}/values` without filters returns all values of the current result version. Filters are recommended and follow the SDMX REST API v2: `c[<dimension>]=<codes>` per dimension, also for the time period, with the SDMX operators (for example `c[time_period]=ge:2023`). Further parameters: `format` (`jsonstat` as default or `csv`), `result_version` (the current one if not stated) and `updatedAfter` (only values changed since that point in time). Unknown or unsupported parameters are rejected with an error according to RFC 9457. |
| Mapping | Fixed rules for mapping indicator, dimensions, values and status to the JSON-stat structure (below). |
| Vocabulary | Observation status and unit multiplier from the SDMX code lists `CL_OBS_STATUS` and `CL_UNIT_MULT`, frequency (if stated) from `CL_FREQ`; time periods in the SDMX time format; code lists of the dimensions from the schemas of the input data, versioned in the catalogue. |
| CSV | CSV according to RFC 4180, UTF-8, comma as delimiter, point as decimal separator; one row per value with fixed columns (below). |

## Mapping to JSON-stat

| JSON-stat element | Content | Base model |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `label` | Title of the indicator | Indicator definition |
| `id`, `size` | Dimensions in the order of the indicator definition, `time_period` last; number of codes per dimension | Dimensions of the indicator definition |
| `role` | `time` for `time_period`; `geo` for the geographic dimension, if the indicator definition marks one | Indicator definition |
| `dimension.{name}.category` | `index` with the codes, `label` with the labels from the code list | Code lists of the indicator definition |
| `value` | Values in the order of the dimensions, missing values as `null` | Indicator value |
| `status` | Observation status per value, codes from SDMX `CL_OBS_STATUS`, in any of the JSON-stat forms (single string, array or object by position). A value without an entry has the status `A` (normal value) | Observation status of the indicator value |
| `updated` | Calculation time of the result version | Provenance record |
| `extension` | `indicator_id`, `definition_version`, `result_version`, `unit`, `based_on_withdrawn` (if the result version is based on a withdrawn dataset version) | Indicator value, provenance record |
| `dimension.{name}.href` | Reference to the code list of the dimension as a JSON-stat dimension response (with version) | Code list in the catalogue |

Example, for the unemployment rate by region:

```http
GET /indicators/ur/values?format=jsonstat&c[region]=R01,R02&c[time_period]=2023,2024
```

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "class": "dataset",
  "label": "Unemployment rate",
  "id": ["region", "time_period"],
  "size": [2, 2],
  "role": { "time": ["time_period"], "geo": ["region"] },
  "updated": "2026-09-30T08:00:00Z",
  "dimension": {
    "region": {
      "label": "Region",
      "category": {
        "index": ["R01", "R02"],
        "label": { "R01": "North region", "R02": "South region" }
      }
    },
    "time_period": {
      "label": "Time period",
      "category": { "index": ["2023", "2024"] }
    }
  },
  "value": [3.9, 4.2, 3.4, 3.7],
  "status": { "1": "P", "3": "P" },
  "extension": {
    "indicator_id": "ur",
    "definition_version": "2",
    "result_version": "c-501",
    "unit": "%"
  }
}
```

Regions, values and identifiers are fictitious. The status `P` is the code for provisional values from the SDMX code list `CL_OBS_STATUS`; the values at positions 0 and 2 have no entry and therefore the status `A`.

## CSV in long format

A query always concerns one indicator, so the columns are fixed by its definition: one row per value, one column per dimension (named as in the indicator definition) and fixed columns for everything else.

| Column | Content |
| ------ | ------- |
| `indicator_id`, `definition_version`, `result_version` | Identifier of the indicator, version of the definition, result version |
| One column per dimension | Code from the code list of the dimension, in the order of the indicator definition |
| `time_period` | Time period in the SDMX time format |
| `value` | Value; empty if missing |
| `observation_status` | Code from `CL_OBS_STATUS`; stated in every row, including `A` for normal values |
| `unit_multiplier` | Code from `CL_UNIT_MULT` |
| `based_on_withdrawn` | `true` if the result version is based on a withdrawn dataset version, otherwise `false`; the same in every row |

```csv
indicator_id,definition_version,result_version,region,time_period,value,observation_status,unit_multiplier,based_on_withdrawn
ur,2,c-501,R01,2023,3.9,A,0,false
ur,2,c-501,R01,2024,4.2,P,0,false
ur,2,c-501,R02,2023,3.4,A,0,false
ur,2,c-501,R02,2024,3.7,P,0,false
```

## Provenance, export and downloads

* `GET /lineage/{id}` returns the provenance record of a calculation as W3C PROV-O in JSON-LD.
* `GET /datasets/{id}/versions/{v}/export?format=csv` exports the content of a dataset version as a CSV file.
* Results above a configured size are delivered as an asynchronous download via `GET /downloads/{id}`.

## Authorisation

Read permissions are governed by the access management of the platform. The building block returns no data and sends no events that the caller is not authorised for.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Open:** whether the building block should maintain its own access classes for datasets and indicators (with the strictest class inherited by indicators and a deliberate release of aggregated values), or leave read permissions entirely to the platform, is not yet decided.
{% endhint %}
